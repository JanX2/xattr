# xattr

This repository contains the source code for an extended file attribute editor. It could be better, but it illustrates the basics.

WARNING: Currently, changes are committed immediately! Please be careful.

Note: many files don’t have attributes—so try a webarchive, a disk image, something with a color label, or with a custom icon.
